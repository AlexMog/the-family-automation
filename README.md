# The Family - How to Automate Your Startup

You will find in this repository a more complete version of the macros/webbots
I've used during my talk.

* [x] **iMacros**: Auto-visit Linkedin profiles.
* [x] **CasperJS**: Retrieve the list of stargazers for a repository on Github.

**Note**: This was of course just an example to show you how easy it is to build
webbots with CasperJS. The ideal solution would have been to use the official
Github API.

You can find and browse the keynote [here](http://www.slideshare.net/gentlenode).
