# The Family - How to Automate Your Startup

[Watch this Workshop on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXGwKojredU). You can also find and browse the keynote [here](http://www.slideshare.net/gentlenode).

You will find in this repository a more complete version of the macros/webbots
I've used during my talk.

* [x] **iMacros**: Auto-visit Linkedin profiles.
* [x] **CasperJS**: Retrieve the list of stargazers and their profile information (password ; website) for a repository on Github. (the example only shows what you can do with the first page)

**Note**: This was of course just an example to show you how easy it is to build webbots with CasperJS. You could for instance use the official Github API to retrieve the whole list of stargazers.
